# E-commerce Dataset Analysis and Linear Regression Model

## Description
In this repository, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an E-commerce dataset and developed a Linear Regression (LR) model to predict future outcomes based on historical data.

## Installation
To run the notebooks in this repository, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

## Usage
You can open the Jupyter Notebooks and run the cells to perform EDA and build the Linear Regression model. The main steps include loading the dataset, cleaning the data, performing EDA, and training the LR model.

## EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step to understand the underlying patterns and structure of the data. In this repository, the EDA includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of data distributions
- Identification of key features and their relationships
- Summary statistics

## Linear Regression Model
Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this repository, the LR model is used to predict the target variable based on the features derived from the EDA. The steps include:
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training the LR model on the training data
- Evaluating the model performance on the testing data

## Results
The results of the EDA and the performance of the Linear Regression model are documented in the notebooks. The key metrics used for evaluation include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
